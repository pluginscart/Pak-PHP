 *	This class provides an easy method for accessing utility objects. It implements the Factory design pattern
 * 
 *  This class contains a single factory method that returns utility objects depending on the user requirements
 *  The utility objects perform useful functions such as logging, encrpytion, database abstraction and general purpose functions

     * The object is stored in an array along with a hash of its parameters
     * The object is also returned
     * 
     * The method calculates the hash of the parameters and stores the object in an array with the hash as the array key
     * This method can instantiate and store multiple instances of an object
     * For example an application can request multiple instances of a database abstraction object
     * Each instance has its own parameters. such as one object per datababse
     * The method throws an exception if the requested object type is not supported
     * 
     * @since 1.0.0
     * @param string $object_type the type of the object that is required. e.g utilities, logging, encrpytion, database etc
     * The $object_type must match the file name of the utility object class. e.g if the file name is authentication.class.php then the $object_type should be authentication
     * The $object_type can also match an alias defined in the $object_alias_list static property
     * @param array $parameters the optional parameters for the object. for e.g for database object it will contain the database connection information
     * 
     * @return object $utility_object an object of the required utility class
